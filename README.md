primecheck
==========

This is a script that will check primes for Diffie Hellman key exchanges.
It currently does two things:
* Check whether the prime is a known, widely used prime
* Check whether the prime is a safe prime

usage
=====

To check the prime of an https server:
  `./primecheck -s [hostname]`

To check a TLS connection on another port:
  `./primecheck -s [hostname] -p [port]`

To check a prime manually:
  `./primecheck -n 0x7`

docker
======

Run
---
  `docker run primecheck -s [hostname]`

Build
-----

  `docker build . -t primecheck`

Shell
-----

  `docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash  primecheck`

notes on openssl usage
======================

As I am not aware of an easy way to extract diffie hellman parameters from a TLS
connection with any readily available Python API I'm using OpenSSL compiled with
the enable-ssl-trace option. This is not on by default, therefore I bundled a
pre-compiled openssl binary. If you don't trust me you may recompile OpenSSL
yourself with trace support and replace the openssl-trace binary.

background
==========

The Logjam Attack and the corresponding research identified several problems in the use of
Diffie Hellman key exchanges.
